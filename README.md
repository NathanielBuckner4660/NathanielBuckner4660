## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this repository â€” a space dedicated to low-level systems programming, Linux tooling, and shell scripting. As a systems programmer, much of my work revolves around understanding how things work under the hood and building tools that interact closely with the operating system.

This repo serves as both a collection of practical utilities and a personal archive of experiments, covering topics like process management, file systems, automation, and performance tuning. Most of the projects here are written with a strong emphasis on portability, minimal dependencies, and Unix philosophy â€” keeping things simple, efficient, and focused.

Shell scripting is at the core of many of these tools, used to glue together system components, automate repetitive tasks, and streamline workflows. Whether itâ€™s writing init scripts, building custom CLI tools, or chaining together standard utilities in creative ways, this repository showcases the power of shell in real-world scenarios.

Beyond Bash and POSIX sh, youâ€™ll also find code and notes related to C programming, Makefiles, system calls, and process lifecycle management â€” essential building blocks for anyone working close to the kernel. Each project is documented with clear usage instructions and comments to make it easier to understand, adapt, and extend.

This repository is open to collaboration and discussion. Whether you're digging into systems programming yourself, looking for lightweight tools, or just exploring how things work beneath the GUI, feel free to fork, file issues, or suggest improvements. Thereâ€™s always more to learn, and feedback is always welcome.

Thanks for stopping by â€” hope you find something useful or interesting here.
